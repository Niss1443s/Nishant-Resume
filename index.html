    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Nishant Kumar Mahato, an undergraduate student at IIM Bangalore. Before joining IIMB, I completed my schooling in Jamshedpur, where I actively participated in photography and videography competitions and created brochures and content for school events. These experiences first sparked my interest in creativity and digital communication.

Alongside my studies, I have explored entrepreneurial projects such as a poster-printing venture and photo-editing services, as well as short-form content creation for local businesses. These initiatives have helped me develop practical skills in marketing, content design, and audience engagement.

I am curious, hardworking, and eager to learn, with a strong interest in marketing, community engagement, and business strategy.</p>
